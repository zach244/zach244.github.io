## Senior Project
[Event Finder](https://github.com/zach244/SeniorProjectUpdated)

This project is what I completed for my Senior Capstone. It is an Android application that uses geolocoation among other useful phone features to allow a user to create, join, and find events near them. For my backend I used Parse which is a BaaS provider hosted on Amazon Web Services. This was by far my largest project I have ever brought to completion by myself therefore learning many useful skills such as refactoring large amounts of code and time management were learned by completing this project. 

## Jave WebServer
[Jave WebServer](https://github.com/zach244/webserver)

This assignment required students to create a multithreaded webserver that took requests through HTTP protocol and respond back with the corresponding content. In order to do this, the student must first parse the request, create the appropriate headers corresponding to the HTTP Protocol and request the content. Once the content is served, the student had to then write the corresponding content back to the socket connection corresponding to the client. This assignment was very successful at giving me experience with JAVA Sockets and HTTP protocol. 

Learning Goal: To	acquire	significant	project	experience working	both individually and	in a	
group	setting.


## Python ChatRoom
[Python ChatRoom](https://github.com/zach244/Python-ChatRoom)

For this assignment two students created a chat room which used a protocol that was created by a group of students in class. This assignment required the students to create a multithreaded server based on the protocol proposed, create a client that that connects to this server using sockets and while providing a GUI interface for the user. This protocol included error codes and other interesting features that added the user in chatting with other participants. This was a very useful assignment as it furthered my knowledge of socket programming, while deepening my understanding of protocols.

Learning Goal: To	attain	a	system	level	understanding	of	the	computer

## Percolation Simulator
[Percolation Simulator](https://github.com/zach244/2420)

This assignment was to create a simulation of Percolation. Percolation is the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter. This assignment was done for class that taught many important data structures and algorithms. This assignment was important as it required the student to implement data structures that were newly learned. Without the proper implementation of these data structures the percolation simulator would not work. 

Learing Goal: To	acquire	significant	project	experience	working	both	individually	and	in	a	
group	setting

## Kd-Trees
[Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/zach244/Assignment-5)
The goal of this assignment was to write a symbol table data type that provides the ability to map from Point2D objects to arbitrary values. A 2d-tree must be implemented to support efficient range search. 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval. This assignment helped me greatly develop my problem-solving skills and gave me the ability to conceptualize more complex algorithms and data structures. This was the last assignment of the course; therefore, it was a great way to use all important algorithms and data structures that were taught over the course of a semester. 

Learning Goal: To	develop	effective	problem-solving	skills.

## Kids Math Helper
[MathProj](https://github.com/zach244/MathProj)
This is a web-based Math teaching aid that is targeted at children between 1st and 3rd grade. This web application was written using Thymleaf Templates, Bootstrap, and Spring while using a MySQL database.  This was a very demanding project as it was the first time that I have ever used a web framework and worked with a relatively large group of students.  We had many frustrating issues starting on this project as it took a large amount of time to learn the framework initially. The next challenge was to get the rest of the team up to speed on the project. In the end we completed important parts of our project, while learning many important aspects of software design and web frameworks. 

Learning Goal: To	understand the	concepts and techniques	of software	design
