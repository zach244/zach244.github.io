## Senior Project
[Event Finder](https://github.com/zach244/SeniorProjectUpdated)

This project is what I completed for my Senior Capstone project. It is an Android application that uses geolocoation among other useful phone features to allow a user to create, join, and find events near them. For my backend I used Parse which is is a BaaS provider hosted on Amazon Web Services. This was by far my largest project I have ever brought to completion therefore learning many useful skills such as refractoring large amounts of code and time managment. 

## Jave WebServer
[Jave WebServer](https://github.com/zach244/webserver)

This assignement required students to create a multithreaded webserver that took requests through HTTP protocol and respond back with the corresponding content. In order to do this, the student must first parse the request, create the appropriate headers corresponding to the HTTP Protocol and request the content. Once the content is served, the student had to then write the corresponding content back to the socket connection corresponding to the client. This assignment was very succesful at giving meexperiance with JAVA Sockets and HTTP protocol. 

Learning Goal: To	acquire	significant	project	experience	working	both	individually	and	in	a	
group	setting.


## Python ChatRoom
[Python ChatRoom](https://github.com/zach244/Python-ChatRoom)

For this assignment two students created a chat room which used a protocol that was created by a group of students in class. This assignment required the students to create a multithreaded server based on the protocol proposed, create a client that that connects to this server using sockets and while providing a GUI interface for the user. This was a very useful assignment as it furthered my knowledge of socket programming, while deepening my understanding of protocols.

Learning Goal: To	attain	a	system	level	understanding	of	the	computer

## Percolation Simulator
[Percolation Simulator](https://github.com/zach244/2420)

This assignment was to create a simulation of Percolation. Percolation is the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter. This assignment was done in my Data Structures and Algorithms class to implement some of the newly learned data structures. This assignment was very beneficial as it was necesary to implement many different data structures in this assignment in order to simulate percolation.

## Nearest Neighbor Implementation
[Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/zach244/Assignment-5)

Learning Goal: To	develop	effective	problem	solving	skills.

## Kids Math Helper
[MathProj](https://github.com/zach244/MathProj)

Learning Goal: To	understand the	concepts and techniques	of software	design
