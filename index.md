## Senior Project
[Event Finder](https://github.com/zach244/SeniorProjectUpdated)

This project is what I completed for my Senior Capstone project. It is an Android application that uses geolocoation among other useful phone features to allow a user to create, join, and find events near them. For my backend I used Parse which is is a BaaS provider hosted on Amazon Web Services. This was by far my largest project I have ever brought to completion therefore learning many useful skills such as refractoring large amounts of code and time managment. 

## Jave WebServer
[Jave WebServer](https://github.com/zach244/webserver)

This assignement required students to create a multithreaded webserver that took requests through HTTP protocol and respond back with the corresponding content. In order to do this, the student must first parse the request, create the appropriate headers corresponding to the HTTP Protocol and request the content. Once the content is served, the student had to then write the corresponding content back to the socket connection corresponding to the client. This assignment was very succesful at giving meexperiance with JAVA Sockets and HTTP protocol. 

Learning Goal: To	acquire	significant	project	experience	working	both	individually	and	in	a	
group	setting.


## Python ChatRoom
[Python ChatRoom](https://github.com/zach244/Python-ChatRoom)

For this assignment two students created a chat room which used a protocol that was created by a group of students in class. This assignment required the students to create a multithreaded server based on the protocol proposed, create a client that that connects to this server using sockets and while providing a GUI interface for the user. This was a very useful assignment as it furthered my knowledge of socket programming, while deepening my understanding of protocols.

Learning Goal: To	attain	a	system	level	understanding	of	the	computer

## Percolation Simulator
[Percolation Simulator](https://github.com/zach244/2420)

This assignment was to create a simulation of Percolation. Percolation is the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter. This assignment was done in my Data Structures and Algorithms class to implement some of the newly learned data structures. This assignment was very beneficial as it was necesary to implement many different data structures in this assignment in order to simulate percolation.

## Nearest Neighbor Implementation
[Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/zach244/Assignment-5)
The goal of this assignment was to write a symobl table data type that provides the ability to map from Point2D objects to arbitrary values. A 2d-tree must be implemented to support efficient range search. 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval. This assignment helped me greatly develop my problem solving skills and gave me the ability to conceptionalize more comple algorithms and data structures. 

Learning Goal: To	develop	effective	problem	solving	skills.

## Kids Math Helper
[MathProj](https://github.com/zach244/MathProj)
This is a web based Math teaching aid that is targeted at children between 1st and 3rd grade. This web application was written using Thymleaf Templates, Spring and MySQL server.  This was a very demanding project as it was the first time that I have ever used a web framework, and worked with a relativly large group of students.  We had many frustrating issues starting on this project as it took a large amount of time to learn my first framework, and get the rest of the team up to speed on the project. In the end we completed important parts of our project, while learning many important aspects of software design and web framworks. 

Learning Goal: To	understand the	concepts and techniques	of software	design
